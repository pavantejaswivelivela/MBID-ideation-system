            MBI<span style="color: red;">D</span> stands for <u>M</u>ultifunctional <u>B</u>io-<u>i</u>nspired <u>D</u>esign is a structured design ideation system facilitates the creation of 
            <b>advanced, bio-inspired multifunctional conceptual designs,</b> ranging from devices to systems.
            It offers a systematic method for conceptualizing and engineering innovative solutions by integrating morphological 
            features found in nature. The output of the MBID ideation system is <b>embodiment-level design concepts</b> 
            that are functionally grounded and ready for further validation. 
            These concepts are applicable across diverse industries, where multifunctionality and structural innovation are critical.

            <em>Figure 1</em> illustrates the diverse applications of MBID across various sectors, 
            including <span style="color: red;">medical</span> (e.g., painless sutures), 
            <span style="color: red;">robotics</span> (e.g., non-pneumatic tires), 
            <span style="color: red;">aerospace</span> (e.g., heat-absorbing structures), 
            <span style="color: red;">marine</span> (e.g., bio-inspired skins), and
            <span style="color: red;">sports: wearables</span> (e.g., helmets for protection)

        <figcaption>Figure 1: Illustrates the cross-sector applicability of the MBID ideation system through example use cases. 
                    These include::
                    (a) Painless suture pin/leg design for reduced puncture force and improved grip;
                    (b) Non-pneumatic tire design for friction management and impact resistance;
                    (c) Heat-absorbing structures with low pressure drop for aerospace applications;
                    (d) Marine skins for enhanced drag reduction and lightweight performance;
                    (e) Helmet designs integrating drag reduction, sweat absorption, and impact protection
                    Each example demonstrates how MBID outputs embodiment designs that merge 
                    biological insight with engineering functionality. (pictures of biological organisms from wikimedia commons)

        <p>
            As illustrated in <em>Figure 2(a)</em>, the MBI<span style="color: red;">D</span><b> ideation system<b> provides a structured process <b>bridging early-stage problem definition and embodiment design with functional verification</b>. 
            <em>Figure 2(b)</em> outlines the key components of the system: identification, abstraction and mapping, 
            function - structure relationships, classification, visualisation, selection, and combination.

        <p>
            This web application features a <b>tree dendrogram visualization of the <span style="color: red;">BIKAS</span></b> database—an evolving repository of over <b>60 biological (morphological) 
            features</b> that have been abstracted, mapped, and classified based on their structural characteristics. 
            <b style="color: red;">BIKAS</b> (Biologically Inspired Knowledge Acquisition and Simulacrum) serves as the core knowledge base for the MBI<span style="color: red;">D</span> framework.
        </p>

        <p>The denrograms represent a <b>hierarchical clustering</b> of morphological features, using an approach analogous to <b>agglomerative clustering</b>.
           Fetures are grouped based on <b>shared geometric characteristics/designation</b>, allowing users to intuitively navigate and select combinations for multifunctional design applications.
