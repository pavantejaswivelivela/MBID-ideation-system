        <h3>Morphology-<span style="color: red;">driven</span> approach</h3>
            <p>
                Biological organisms achieve a vast array of functions through a 
                combination of their morphology (structure), physiology (how they work), and behavior as depicted in <em>Figure 3</em>. 
                The MBI<span style="color: red;">D</span> approach, however, specifically 
                focuses on functions derived from morphological features. We call these <b>embodiment functions</b>.

        <h3>Diversity-<span style="color: red;">enhanced</span></h3>
        <p>
            Nature often provides elegant solutions. Distantly related organisms, despite their evolutionary paths, 
            frequently develop similar structural designs to perform identical functions. 
            MBI<span style="color: red;">D</span> uses this principle to explore the extensive morphological diversity found across both plant and animal kingdoms. 
            This broad exploration significantly expands the potential design solutions for various engineering challenges.

            The MBID Ideation System is built upon several key components. <em>Figure 4</em> is an illustration
            describing the key components starting from identification, abstraction & mapping, function-structrue relationship, classification, visualisation, selection and combination.

        <h3 style="color: red;">ABSTRACT & MAP</h3>
        <p>
            Each biological (morphological) feature is meticulously mapped to its corresponding function and the tissue (material) from which it originates. 
            Furthermore, the embodiment function achieved by a feature is understood as a blend of its integrated structure and its structural strategy (configuration).
        </p>

        <h3>Function-Structure <span style="color: red;"> Realtionship</span></h3>
        <p>
            The embodiment function is a synergistic outcome of an integrated structure and its structural strategy.
            <em>Figure 5</em> is a schematic illustrating the embodiment function of a lotus leaf in repelling water. 
            This function results from a combination of micro/nano projections (integrated structure) 
            on the leaf's surface and the arrangement of these micro/nano structures (structural strategy).     
        </p>

            <b>Integrated structure</b> refers to the physical description of a multiscale structure. 
            This includes details like micro/nanostructure, macrostructure, and even the presence of features like wax layers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Structural strategy</b> defines the integrated structural configuration. This encompasses aspects such as the arrangement, packing, 
            or orientation of micro/nanostructures, symmetry, asymmetry, or tessellation patterns. It also accounts for 
            changes in structural configuration due to external stimuli, 
            such as the erection of scales or a change in skin compliance, which occur when other elements interact with the structure.
            <em>Table 1</em> is an example of the lotus leaf's morphology contributing to its exhibited repel water function.

        <h3 style="color: red;">CLASSIFY</h3>
        <p>
            The biological (morphological) features are identified, abstracted, mapped, 
            and classified based on their shared geometric characteristics, referred to in this research as <b style="color: red;">Domains</b>. 
            These Domains represent overarching structural designations that guide the classification process and include: <b>Surfaces, Cellular Structures,
            Cross-sections, and Shapes</b>
            The <em>Figure 6</em> illustrates a classification system for biological features, categorizing them into distinct domains based on their primary geometric characteristic or designation.

            <h4>Understanding <span style="color: red;">classification:</span></h4>
            For instance, features whose function arises 
            from body or skin texture, scales, body coats, or hard outer coverings like composites, tiles, plates, and sandwich panels are classified under the 
            <span style="color: red;">surfaces domain</span>.
            The features whose function arises through porous, prismatic, and foam structures arranged in periodic (non-stochastic), 
            stochastic, or hierarchical tessellated patterns, it falls into the <span style="color: red;">cellular structures domain</span>. 
    
            Similarly, the features whose function arises by the overall shape of the body (body contour) or the shape of 
            a specific body part, the feature is categorized within the <span style="color: red;">shapes domain</span>.    
    
            Finally, features whose function is derived from 
            the cross-section of the body or the cross-section of a particular body part are classified as belonging to the 
            <span style="color: red;">cross-sections domain</span>.The <em>Table 2</em> is an example of 
            the abstraction & mapping and classification of the Lotus leaf's morphology.

        <h4> The challenge of <span style="color: red;">classifying complex biological features</span></h4>
            <p>
                Biological features are inherently complex, making their systematic classification into a finite number of distinct domains a significant challenge. 
                Often, a single biological feature integrates characteristics that, at first glance, seem to belong to multiple domains.
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider the kingfisher's beak as an example. Its structure combines a hard outer covering, which aligns with the surfaces domain, and inner cellular bone, clearly belonging to the cellular structures domain. 
                However, the beak's primary function is derived from its cross-sectional geometry. 
                Therefore, despite its multi-domain characteristics, it's primarily classified under the cross-sections domain due to this functional emphasis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Similarly, features within the shapes domain often arise from a combination of characteristics from both the surfaces and cross-sections domains. 
                Yet, their classification as "shapes" is driven by the fact that their function primarily stems from the overall shape or contour of the body or a specific part of it.
            </p>

        <h3 style="color: red;">VISUALISE</h3>
        <p>
           The MBI<span style="color: red;">D</span> ideation system currently abstracts, maps, and classifies approximately 60 biological features based on shared geometric characteristics, 
           referred to as domains. This growing knowledge base, known as <span style="color: red;">BIKSAS</span> (Bio-Inspired Knowledge Acquisition and Simulacrum), is continuously expanding. 
           To support intuitive exploration, <b>tree dendrograms</b> are used to visualize these features, enabling users to select and combine them to generate multifunctional design concepts.   
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: red;">SELECT</h3>
        <p>
              In nature, multiple features might share similar geometric characteristics and perform similar functions. 
              For instance, both shark and dolphin skin contribute to drag reduction. To choose among such alternatives (e.g., shark skin vs. dolphin skin for drag reduction), 
              we apply meta-level design parameters and specific design criteria.The <em>Table 3</em> presents quantitative parameters developed for 
              selecting features that exhibit similar functions and share comparable geometric characteristics or domains.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Criterion 1:</b> For multifunctional applications where one function involves anti-adsorption, 
            absorption, repulsion, or reduction, select features with a lower total interaction area for combination.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Criterion 2:</b> For multifunctional applications where one function involves adsorption, 
            absorption, or attraction, select features with a higher interaction area for combination.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Qualitative <span style="color: red;">parameters</h4>
        <p>    
           Users can also incorporate additional qualitative criteria into their selections, such as the environmental context where the design will be applied. 
           For instance, when designing a device for arid regions, users could choose to include biological adaptations specific to those environments 
        </p>

        <table>
            <caption>Table 3: Meta-level design parameters for selection for each domain</caption>
            <tr> <!--Row 1 header-->

           <em> Note: These meta-level design parameters are just a starting point; we'll add more as the system evolves.</em>
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: red;">COMBINE</h3>
        <p>
            The morphology matrix is used to combine different morphological features systematically.
        </p>

        <h3>Morphology & <span style="color: red;">Multifunctionality</span></h3>
        <p>
            Some morphological features are inherently multifunctional. 
            For example, animal exoskeletons must simultaneously fulfill various roles like providing fracture toughness, 
            regulating temperature, and offering camouflage. 
            While these functions can coexist and even compete, MBID systematically combines multiple morphological features. 
            This allows us to create novel engineering structures with function combinations that extend beyond merely coexisting or competing functions.

        <h2>LEGO<span style="color: red;"> ANALOGY</span></h3>
         <p>
            Imagine each domain within the MBI<span style="color: red;">D</span> as a distinct bag of Lego blocks, 
            where each block represents a specific biological feature or characteristic. 
            The blocks within a single bag share a similar geometric designation 
            (e.g., all "Surface" blocks have surface-level characteristics, all "Cellular Structure" blocks relate to porous or internal structures). 
            The core idea is that by thoughtfully integrating different types of Lego blocks drawn from these 
            various bags, designers can construct novel multifunctional conceptual designs. The <em>Figure 7</em> illustrating the analogy between
