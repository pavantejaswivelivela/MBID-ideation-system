        <p>This section provides a 
         step-by-step guide to generate 
         multifunctional designs using the MBI<span style="color: red;">D</span> ideation system.
         As shown in the <em>Figure 8</em>, MBID users can access online sources for visual cues of 
         various structures. Currently, the MBID ideation system offers a structured design framework, 
         including graphical mapping and representation of these structures.

            <p>
                The MBID system supports two modes of design generation:    
            </p>
           <p>
                <b>Problem-Driven Design</b>: Begin with a design problem, identify required functions, 
                and generate a multifunctional solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Solution-Driven Design</b>: Select and integrate biological 
                functions of interest to generate a novel multifunctional concept
           </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id ='example'>
        <h2>Example <span style="color: red;">Walkthorugh</span></h2>
        
        <p>
            <b>Problem Statement</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Design a multifunctional non-pneumatic 
            tire for space robotics or extreme-weather vehicles that: <b> "Manages variable friction" and
            "Resists impact"</b>
        </p>
        
        <div>
            <h3><span style="color: red;">Step 1:</span> Choosing relevant Domains</h3>
            <p>
                The initial selection of domains for integration is driven by two key factors: the designer's 
                specific intention for the concept and the overarching requirements of the design problem at hand.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3><span style="color: red;">Step 2:</span> Explore domain dendrograms</h3>

            <dl> <!--Description list-->
                <dt><b>Surfaces Domain</b></dt> <!--heading-->
                <dd style="padding: 15px;">
                    Match the function “manage variable friction” with a biological feature.
                    For example, <b>Snakeskin</b> texture has <b>integrated structure</b> i.e., triangular microstructures (scales), additional
                    has a <b>structural configuration</b>: longitudinal pits, caudal elevation, and anisotropy of microstructures.

                <dt><b>Cellular structures Domain</b></dt>
                <dd style="padding: 15px;">
                    Match the function “resist impact” with a biological feature.
                    For example, <b>Woodpecker's beak</b> has <b>integrated structure</b> i.e., trabecular foam core sandwiched between hard outer shells
                    and has a <b>structural configuration</b>: variable porosities—outer (30%), middle (65%), inner (30%)

            <h3><span style="color: red;">Step 3:</span> Select features using meta-level <span style="color: red;"> design</span> parameters</h3>
            <p>
                Multiple features may serve the same function. As shown in <em>Figure 9</em>, the Woodpecker's beak and the Pomelo peel exhibit
                "resist impact" function and belong to the Cellular structures domain.
                To choose between features that have the same geometric 
                characteristic (domain) and exhibit the same function, quantitative parameters 
                called meta-level design parameters were introduced and are listed in <em>Table 4</em>. To choose between alternatives, apply the design criterion:
            </p>

            <figcaption>Fig 9: (a) Manage variable friction is exhibited by the snakeskin that is classified as surfaces domain.
                (b) Resist impact function is exhibited by the Woodpecker beak and the Pomelo peel and are classified as cellular structures domain.

                    <dd style="padding: 15px;">
                        For any multifunctional application, if one of the multifunction is described as an anti-adsorption / absorption or 
                        repulsion or reduction, select the features with a lower total interaction area for combination.
                    </dd>

                <dt><b>Criterion 2</b></dt>
                    <dd style="padding: 15px;">
                        For any multifunctional application, if one of the multifunction can be described as 
                        adsorption/absorption or attraction, select the features with a higher interaction area for combination.
                    </dd>

            </dl>

            <p>
                In the case of cellular structures choose the <b>woodpeckers beak</b> 
                as it has a <b>high interaction area</b> and <b>low porosity</b> at the contact with the ground.
            </p>

            <p style="color: red;">
                <em> Note: These meta-level design parameters are just a starting point; we'll add more as the system evolves.</em>

            <h4>Qualitative <span style="color: red;">parameters</h4>
            <p>    
                Users can also incorporate additional qualitative criteria into their selections, such as the environmental context where the design will be applied. 
                For instance, when designing a device for arid regions, users could choose to include biological adaptations specific to those environments

                The design integrates the surface features of snake skin for friction management and the internal structure of a woodpecker's beak for impact resistance. 
                These tires are potentially suitable for use in high-terrain regions.
